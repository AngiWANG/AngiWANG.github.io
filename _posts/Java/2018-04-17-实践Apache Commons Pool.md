[The Apache Commons Pool ](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-pool/)open source software library provides an `object-pooling` API and a number of object pool implementations. Version 2 of Apache Commons Pool contains a completely re-written pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.  In addition to performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust instance tracking and pool monitoring. Version 2 requires JDK level 1.6 or above.
